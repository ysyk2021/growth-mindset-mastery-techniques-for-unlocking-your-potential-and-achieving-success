Embracing Challenges and Failure
--------------------------------

Embracing challenges and failure requires a growth mindset, which involves a willingness to take risks, learn from mistakes, and persist in the face of obstacles.

### Strategies for Practicing Embracing Challenges

4. **Accept discomfort:** Embrace discomfort and uncertainty as opportunities for growth and learning.

### Strategies for Learning from Failure

1. **Reflect on mistakes:** Reflect on mistakes and identify what went wrong and what could be done differently in the future.
