1. **Growth mindset:** A growth mindset is a belief that intelligence and abilities are not fixed and can be developed through dedication, effort, and practice. Individuals with a growth mindset view challenges as an opportunity for growth and learning. They embrace failures and setbacks as part of their development journey, and believe in the power of effort and hard work.

2. **Fixed mindset:** A fixed mindset is a belief that intelligence and abilities are innate and cannot be changed. Individuals with a fixed mindset may avoid challenges, fearing failure or negative feedback. They may also view effort and practice as pointless, believing that talent and ability are the only factors that contribute to success.

3. **Psychology and neuroscience research:** Research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience has shown that the brain is malleable and capable of constantly changing and forming new connections throughout life. Through neuroplasticity, individuals can develop new skills and abilities, regardless of their starting point.
